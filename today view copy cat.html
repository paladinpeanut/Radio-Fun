<h2/>An iPhone widget's page Example</h2> <br>
// today's Date code or API here.

// weather widget here for Clearwater, FL
<details/>Click this button to read if you don't use audio.</details>
<p/>This is an example of using simple JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to make an iPhone like app interface without having to use Swift. This way it works on every device without a lot of extra hassle.</p>
<p/>It's designed to resemble the iPhone's Today View, which yu can reach by swiping with three fingers from left to right on the home screen. It isn't an exact replica, but simply demonstrates that a replica with similar functionality is much easier than often portrayed by, ahem! Apple.</p>
<p/>The next page forward will demonstrate an app like interface, only using buttons and a table for the tabs at the bottom.</p>
